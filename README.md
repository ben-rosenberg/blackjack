# Blackjack

A simple console-based Blackjack card game coded in C++. The first commit (5/26/2023) functions but requires improvements to the flow and functionality of the game.

I'm only just learning to use `make`, and as such, the Makefile is very much a work in progress. That being said, assuming your operating system has a version of `make` installed as well as G++, this project can be compiled into a binary by simply running `make`.
