# Blackjack

A simple console-based Blackjack card game coded in C++. The first commit (5/26/2023) functions but requires improvements to the flow and functionality of the game.

I've only just begun learning Make, so the usage in the current Makefile is rudimentary at best. I know that this usage effectively negates the value of Make, as it does not take advantage of prerequisites and conditional compilation. That being said, assuming your operating system has a version of Make installed, this project can be compiled into a binary by simply running `make`.
